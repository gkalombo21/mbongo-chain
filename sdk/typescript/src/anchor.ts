/**
 * `AnchorReceipt` transaction construction, signing and submission.
 *
 * Anchoring puts a signed receipt inside a transaction that is itself signed.
 * The two signatures are **different**, and confusing them is the mistake this
 * module is shaped to prevent:
 *
 * | | key | message |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `receipt.signature` | executor | the raw 32 bytes of `receiptHash` |
 * | transaction signature | sender | the **raw** transaction signing payload |
 *
 * Consensus requires `sender == receipt.executor`, so one key produces both.
 * The messages still differ, so the signatures differ. The transaction
 * signature has **no prehash**: it is over the raw payload bytes, never over a
 * digest of them.
 *
 * Correctness is checked against
 * `test-vectors/transaction/anchor-receipt-v1.json`, the shared fixture Rust
 * also reads. That file is the source of truth; no expected value is
 * duplicated here.
 *
 * Authority:
 * - `crates/mbongo-core/src/primitives.rs` — `Transaction`, `TransactionType`,
 *   `TransactionPayload`, `Transaction::signing_payload`
 * - `crates/mbongo-node/src/backend.rs` — admission and consensus rules
 * - `docs/rfcs/0002-receipt-anchoring-v0.3.md`; `PROTOCOL_LOCK_v0.3` (FROZEN)
