/**
 * Baseline JSON-RPC client for the Mbongo Chain node.
 *
 * Covers exactly the six methods specified by `docs/specs/rpc_v0.3.md`,
 * which are the six of the frozen `rpc_v0.2.md` with the transaction payload
 * union widened by one variant. Nothing else is exposed: reserved compute
 * methods are unavailable on the node and are not wrapped here. Receipt,
 * anchoring and compute-task helpers live in their own modules and compose
 * this client.
 *
 * ## Exact integers
 *
 * Requests and responses go through `json-exact.ts` rather than
 * `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`. The wire is unchanged — integers remain
 * JSON numbers, method names and shapes are identical — but a `u64` no longer
 * loses digits crossing into JavaScript.
 *
 * The parser hands back every integer token as `bigint`. That is a transport
 * detail, not the public shape: {@link normalizeBlock} and its neighbours map
 * each field to the type its domain calls for, so `error.code` and
 * `receipt.version` stay numbers while `amount`, `nonce`, `height` and
 * `timestamp` stay exact.
