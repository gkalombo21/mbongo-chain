//! Reference control plane (E): coordination, and only coordination.
//!
//! The control plane observes tasks and receipts on the chain, admits
//! workers under an executor identity they prove, issues short execution
//! leases with attempt identities, obtains data-plane capabilities under
//! those leases as the client's delegated issuer, and records what each
//! attempt reported. It holds **no executor key**: it can relay a
//! signature and can never produce one (E §11.1). It cannot change
//! `task.executor` — it does not even have a field for it, and the data
//! plane checks the chain-committed executor independently (F §5.1).
//!
//! Its database is never protocol truth (E5). Everything chain-derived in
//! it is a cache re-derivable by block scan; leases and attempts are
//! durable coordination state whose loss costs a restart round-trip, not
//! correctness (E §15–16).
