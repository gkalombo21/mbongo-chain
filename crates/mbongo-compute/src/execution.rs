//! The reference execution profile, and the reference commitment convention.
//!
//! # REFERENCE / TEST EXECUTION PROFILE
//!
//! The only profile this crate runs reverses the input bytes. It exists to
//! prove the lifecycle — fetch, verify, execute, persist, commit, receipt —
//! with a transform whose output is deterministic and checkable by anyone
//! holding the input. It is not, and does not pretend to be, the production
//! compute model. Nothing about it is consensus: the chain treats
//! `execution_spec` as opaque bytes (RFC 0005 §2.12) and never learns what a
//! worker did with them.
//!
//! # Reference-worker implementation conventions (non-consensus)
//!
//! Two conventions let a client and this worker agree without any protocol
//! change:
//!
//! - **profile selection** — `execution_spec` is the ASCII tag
//!   [`REVERSE_BYTES_SPEC`]. The worker refuses any other spec. This is the
//!   application-versioned tagging RFC 0005 §2.12 recommends; the chain
//!   enforces none of it.
//! - **commitments** — the RFC 0005 §2.4 interoperability convention,
//!   `BLAKE3(DOMAIN_INPUT || bytes)` and `BLAKE3(DOMAIN_OUTPUT || bytes)`,
//!   over the raw input and output bytes. The chain compares commitments
//!   for equality and never learns the derivation; a client that blinds its
//!   commitment is equally valid on-chain and would agree a different
//!   convention with its worker (F §7–8). The reference profile uses the
//!   plain form because it is the simplest one to verify in a test.
//!
//! # Plaintext
//!
//! This is **ordinary execution**: the process running the profile holds
//! the input and output in clear. Provider confidentiality is not claimed.
//! The one point where a confidential profile would differ is
//! [`ConfidentialExtension`], which this crate names and does not
//! implement.
