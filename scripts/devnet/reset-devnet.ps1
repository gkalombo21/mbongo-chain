# Resets the v0.4 devnet deployment to a fresh-genesis state by wiping
# ONLY deployment-owned runtime data, after an automatic verified
# backup and two explicit confirmations. Never wipes automatically.
#
# Removed:   node data directories, node logs, PID metadata, node
#            provenance markers, receipt submission records
# Preserved: deployed binaries, node manifest, receipt-tool manifest,
#            all backups, build sources/worktrees
#
# Confirmations required:
#   1. the -ConfirmReset switch, AND
#   2. the exact resolved deployment root path, typed at the prompt or
#      supplied via -ConfirmRoot (for documented scripted use).
#
# A verified backup is taken automatically before the wipe unless the
# emergency override -EmergencySkipBackupIUnderstandDataLoss is
# supplied. There is no shorter alias for that flag on purpose.
#
# Usage: .\reset-devnet.ps1 -ConfirmReset [-ConfirmRoot <exact root>]
#                           [-EmergencySkipBackupIUnderstandDataLoss]
