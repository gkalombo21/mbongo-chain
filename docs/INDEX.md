## Authority map — what is true today

Each row names the one document that decides its subject. Where another
document disagrees with one of these, this table wins.

| Subject | Authority | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Project vision and scope | [`VISION_v1.md`](VISION_v1.md) | NORMATIVE |
| Frozen protocol surfaces, versioning | [`specs/PROTOCOL_LOCK_v0.3.md`](specs/PROTOCOL_LOCK_v0.3.md) | NORMATIVE |
| JSON-RPC contract | [`specs/rpc_v0.3.md`](specs/rpc_v0.3.md) | NORMATIVE (DRAFT — v0.2 plus the `ComputeTask` payload variant; executably covered; freeze follows the independent audit) |
| JSON-RPC contract before RFC 0005 | [`specs/rpc_v0.2.md`](specs/rpc_v0.2.md) | SUPERSEDED (FROZEN, kept intact) |
| Receipt v1 structure | [`specs/RECEIPT_SPEC_v0.1.md`](specs/RECEIPT_SPEC_v0.1.md) | NORMATIVE |
| Receipt anchoring consensus rules | [`rfcs/0002-receipt-anchoring-v0.3.md`](rfcs/0002-receipt-anchoring-v0.3.md) | NORMATIVE (Accepted) |
| How protocol changes are proposed and accepted | [`RFC_PROCESS.md`](RFC_PROCESS.md) | NORMATIVE |
| Which changes need an RFC | [`CONTRIBUTION_TIERS.md`](CONTRIBUTION_TIERS.md) | NORMATIVE |
| Contribution workflow | [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) | NORMATIVE |
| What counts as engineering proof | [`ENGINEERING_EVIDENCE.md`](ENGINEERING_EVIDENCE.md) | NORMATIVE |
| Receipt anchoring: data model, crypto domains, storage | [`architecture/compute-receipts.md`](architecture/compute-receipts.md) | CURRENT |
| Where customer and model data may exist across Compute; the public-chain / control-plane / private-data-plane boundary | [`architecture/compute-privacy-data-plane.md`](architecture/compute-privacy-data-plane.md) | NORMATIVE (architecture, non-consensus — RFC 0005 wins on protocol) |
| How a client, the control plane, the private data plane and a worker hand private inputs and results to one another | [`architecture/compute-private-data-plane-interface.md`](architecture/compute-private-data-plane-interface.md) | NORMATIVE (architecture, non-consensus — RFC 0005 wins on protocol) |
| What the control plane may and must do between an accepted `ComputeTask` and an anchored receipt; leases, attempts, retry, duplicate handling, receipt relay | [`architecture/compute-control-plane-worker-interface.md`](architecture/compute-control-plane-worker-interface.md) | NORMATIVE (architecture, non-consensus — RFC 0005 wins on protocol) |
| Building, signing, anchoring, verifying receipts | [`development/compute-receipts.md`](development/compute-receipts.md) | CURRENT |
| The reference compute worker, control plane and private data plane: what runs, what is public, what is private, crash and retry | [`development/reference-worker.md`](development/reference-worker.md) | CURRENT (implementation of E and F; not protocol authority) |
| What every compute implementation must satisfy — the named conformance suite (`compute-conformance-v1`), its cases, how a future worker or data plane runs it | [`development/compute-conformance.md`](development/compute-conformance.md) | CURRENT (tests the architecture contracts; not protocol authority) |
| Devnet topology and infrastructure | [`architecture/devnet-infrastructure.md`](architecture/devnet-infrastructure.md) | CURRENT |
| Running a devnet locally | [`development/devnet.md`](development/devnet.md) | CURRENT |
| Devnet operations | [`runbooks/DEVNET_V0.3_OPERATIONS.md`](runbooks/DEVNET_V0.3_OPERATIONS.md) | CURRENT |
| How the SDK is released | [`runbooks/RELEASE.md`](runbooks/RELEASE.md) | NORMATIVE |
| TypeScript SDK | [`../sdk/typescript/README.md`](../sdk/typescript/README.md) | CURRENT |

The shipped RPC surface is **six JSON-RPC methods**. Receipt anchoring travels
through the generic `submit_transaction`; there is no compute RPC, and no
lookup of a receipt by `task_id`.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **NORMATIVE** | Defines a contract or process other documents defer to. |
| **CURRENT** | Accurately describes what is implemented or operated today. |
| **HISTORICAL** | Records past work or evidence. Not current authority. |
| **SUPERSEDED** | A newer authoritative document replaces it. |
| **ASPIRATIONAL** | Describes planned or imagined behaviour that is not implemented. |

Only documents named in the authority map above, or explicitly marked in this
file, carry a status. The rest of the corpus is unclassified.

---

## Reading anything else in this directory

Most of `docs/` was written between November 2025 and February 2026, before
the protocol was locked, before RPC v0.2, and before the vision narrowed to a
verification layer for off-chain inference receipts. Those documents were
written in good faith as design material and remain useful for understanding
intent and history.

**They are not authoritative, and several describe systems that do not
exist.** Unless a document appears in the authority map above, or the sections
below mark it CURRENT or NORMATIVE, assume it records a design idea rather
than the running system, and verify against the code, the specs, or the tests
before relying on it.

Four documents are known to contradict the running system and carry a banner
saying so: [`ts_sdk_overview.md`](ts_sdk_overview.md),
[`rpc_overview.md`](rpc_overview.md),
[`openapi_reference.md`](openapi_reference.md) and
[`governance_model.md`](governance_model.md). Others may be wrong without
having been checked yet.

## Catalogue

Everything below is a map of the corpus, not a statement about correctness.

### Legend

- **[L1]** - High-level overviews and introductions
- **[L2]** - Detailed specifications and guides
- **[L3]** - Implementation details and advanced topics
- **[PRIMARY]** - Most complete document on the topic within this catalogue
- **[ARCHIVE]** - Older version, kept for reference

`[PRIMARY]` marks depth within the catalogue. It does **not** mean current or
authoritative; the authority map above is the only source of that.

### Longest documents in the catalogue

This ranks depth of coverage within the 2025 design corpus. It is not a
statement about what is current, and it is not the authority map — that is at
the top of this file. `rpc_overview.md` below is aspirational; `README.md` is
superseded by this file.

```

## Documentation Reading Paths

**Path 0 is the only one that traverses current documents.** Paths 1 to 6
below were written for the November 2025 corpus and route through design
material, including documents now known to be aspirational. They are kept
because they show how that material was meant to be read, not because they
describe the running system.

### Path 0: What Mbongo Chain currently is
```
1. ../README.md                            what runs today, how to start it
2. VISION_v1.md                            scope, and what is excluded
3. specs/PROTOCOL_LOCK_v0.3.md             which surfaces are frozen
4. specs/rpc_v0.3.md                       the RPC contract
5. architecture/compute-receipts.md        receipts on chain
6. ../sdk/typescript/README.md             the shipped SDK
7. RFC_PROCESS.md                          how any of it changes
```

### Path 1: New User (Non-Technical)
```
1. vision.md
2. mbongo_whitepaper.md
3. faq.md
4. competitive_analysis.md
5. target_market.md
```

### Path 2: Developer (Getting Started)
```
1. getting_started.md
2. developer_guide.md
3. developer_environment.md
4. rust_sdk_overview.md
5. cli_overview.md
```
For the SDK and the RPC contract this path is superseded by Path 0:
`../sdk/typescript/README.md` and `specs/rpc_v0.2.md`. The documents it
used to name here, `ts_sdk_overview.md` and `rpc_overview.md`, are
aspirational.

### Path 3: Validator (Operations)
```
1. consensus_master_overview.md
2. pox_formula.md
3. economic_security.md
4. validator_setup.md
5. setup_validation.md
6. cli_node.md
```

### Path 4: Compute Provider
```
1. poc_consensus_mechanics.md
2. compute_value.md
3. verification_strategy.md
4. compute_provider_setup.md
5. compute_engine_overview.md
```

### Path 5: Blockchain Architect (Technical Deep Dive)
```
1. architecture_master_overview.md
2. consensus_master_overview.md
3. pox_formula.md
4. verification_strategy.md
5. sybil_resistance.md
6. economic_security.md
7. execution_engine_overview.md
8. compute_engine_overview.md
9. state_machine_validation.md
```

### Path 6: Economist/Tokenomics Analyst
```
1. token_intro.md
2. supply_schedule.md
3. economic_security.md
4. staking_model.md
5. incentive_design.md
6. fee_model.md
7. governance_model.md
8. utility_value.md
```
